# Introduction
Welcome to HeroUI Vue.

## What is HeroUI Vue
HeroUI Vue is a Vue 3 component library based on [HeroUI Theme](https://www.heroui.com/). It provides a set of modern, typed components built on HeroUI's design foundation, reimplemented in Vue 3 while following HeroUI's design specifications.

## How is it different from HeroUI?
HeroUI Vue is a passion project that is technically based on [HeroUI's theme package](https://npmjs.com/package/@heroui/theme) and implemented in Vue.

## Why develop it?
Since becoming a frontend developer, the idea of "developing my own component library" has been lingering in my mind. But with my knowledge and abilities at the time, plus the existence of many component libraries in the community, I didn't have the motivation to implement this idea. Until I came across HeroUI, a component library that impressed me deeply. Its beautiful style design and comfortable interactive effects deeply attracted me. But HeroUI is React-based, which doesn't match my tech stack, and I couldn't find a Vue-based HeroUI implementation in the community. So, it was a perfect match!

## Is it production ready?
**No!** If you want to use HeroUI Vue in a production environment, I suggest you wait for some time. Because it's still in the early stages, there may be many bugs and imperfections, and this project doesn't have enough maintainers.
